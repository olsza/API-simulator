# API Simulator

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ API Simulator is a forthcoming project intended to facilitate the local simulation of real APIs without the need for an internet connection. Its primary goal is to empower developers to control responses and data through a planned panel.

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± API Simulator czyli symulator API to nadchodzÄ…cy projekt majÄ…cy na celu uÅ‚atwienie lokalnej symulacji prawdziwych interfejsÃ³w API bez koniecznoÅ›ci poÅ‚Ä…czenia z Internetem. Jego gÅ‚Ã³wnym celem jest umoÅ¼liwienie programistom kontrolowania odpowiedzi i danych za poÅ›rednictwem planowanego panelu.


## Project Description

"API Simulator" (or APIs for short) is envisioned as a solution for simulating APIs locally, without relying on internet connectivity. While some entities offer the option to test their APIs on a testing server, many other providers do not. APIs will enable developers to simulate API behavior locally, potentially utilizing Docker for deployment.

The project will feature a planned panel where users can configure desired responses. For instance, users will be able to define domain bases, specifying occupancy status, expiration dates, blockages, or even set pricing structures, among other options. This feature will empower developers to define parameters for testing purposes, eliminating the need to connect to a testing server.

Future plans for this Open Source project include adding modules for simulating APIs from various providers.

## Planned Features

- Local simulation of real APIs.
- Control over responses and data via a user-friendly panel (planned).
- Compatibility with Docker for straightforward deployment and management.
- Addition of modules for simulating APIs from different providers.

## Contributing
